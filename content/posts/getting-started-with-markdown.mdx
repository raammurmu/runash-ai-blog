## Why Markdown?

Markdown keeps writing fast and focused. You can produce readable content with minimal syntax.

### Example list

- Fast authoring
- Easy formatting
- Better portability

### Code block

```ts
const message = "Hello from MDX support";
console.log(message);
```

> You can now publish Markdown/MDX-like posts from the `content/posts` folder.
